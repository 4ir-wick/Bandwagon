# Bandwagon

Must be tested on a local host or actual host

Flow of events:
starts at Website/login.html
create an account
login to account
edit profile page
user search to search for exact display name in profile page
search by clicking submit after typing name
other pages were never completed but have the general concepts that were meant to be implemented

Creating accounts and saving information will not be possible when the firebase is deleted
When this happens start at Website/ProfilePage.html instead
