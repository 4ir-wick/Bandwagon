# Bandwagon

Must be tested on a local host or actual host  
Link to a hosted version (only exists for a short time after this commit)  
http://ec2-3-83-148-214.compute-1.amazonaws.com/login.html  

Flow of events:  
starts at Website/login.html  
create an account  
login to account  
edit profile page  
user search to search for exact display name in profile page  
search by clicking submit after typing name  
other pages were never completed but have the general concepts that were meant to be implemented  

Creating accounts and saving information will not be possible when the firebase is deleted  
When this happens start at Website/ProfilePage.html instead
